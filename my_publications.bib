    abstract = {GOPA is a privacy-preserving gossip algorithm for averaging that has applications in decentralized machine learning over P2P networks. This Master's thesis aims to improve the robustness of the algorithm to churns and malicious adversaries. Thanks to the Paillier cryptosystem, commitment schemes and mathematical analysis, we have convincing theoretical results regarding both privacy aspects and correctness of averaging. Notable contributions are a framework for churn-tolerance and a privacy-preserving algorithm for detecting data injections in gossip averaging. In addition, we unify all our improvements around a robust user-centric version of GOPA. All our contributions have proved to be quite novel in comparison with the literature. We also have initiated the development of an Android prototype of GOPA so that our solutions can be experimented in the future. Finally, new theoretical and technical issues have been identified and may be treated as part of a next internship or PhD studies.},
