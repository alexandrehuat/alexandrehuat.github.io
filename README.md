# Miscellaneous

## When you're having troubles managing your life

Younger, I faced a lot of varied problems that caused me psychological disorders. I've wasted a ton of times to deal with, like years, but I finally found real solutions to adress my difficulties. Below are listed three books that truly made me bury these problems and become happier with myself and my pairs. I had significant life improvements when starting them. I sincerely recommend them to you if you recognize yourself in the previews you can read on Amazon. The Kindle versions are very practical to work with.
