## When you're having troubles managing your life

> "One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives." [(World Health Organization, 2001)][mental_dis]

Brain is as valuable as other organs, and mind as observable as other phenomenons.

Sometimes, life is hard, it bends you knees and breaks your heart, people seem rough and you perceive situations as unmanageable. You may feel helpless, hopeless or even become lethargic when such situation are repeated. Younger, I went through such hard times. I have wasted a lot of ressources to deal with. But, by persisting in looking for help, I found real solutions to adress my difficulties.

Thanks to the authors of the three books listed below, I healed my mood and my mind and became smarter and happier with myself and my pairs. These books brought stability and control in my life. These adresses three very common disorders: depression, anxiety and addiction. Not everyone has a good understanding of these conditions, especially people who suffer from them—there are reasons why…

You can read the previews of the books on Amazon, or find critics on the internet, it may help you to build an opinion. If you recognize yourself in one preview, I sincerely recommend the book to you. If you decide to buy one, don't hesitate to choose the Kindle version: it is very practical to work with.
