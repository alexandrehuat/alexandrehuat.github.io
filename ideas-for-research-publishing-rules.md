In the DeepLearning.AI's ["The Batch"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/) newsletter of [17 December 2020](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/rules-for-corporate-ai-researchers/), Andrew Ng asked the deep learning community for ideas for research publishing rules. As you may know, I wish for methodological improvement, so here are my answers to his questions.

1. _Should researchers be allowed to release any technology they wish, as long as they don't publish confidential information?_

It's not only about confidential information but also about property. Property is shared, so the release of technology should always be discussed with the company. We are talking about technologies that have been invented with the material and the collaboration of the rest of the company.

However I understand the idea behind the question, and I think that researchers should inform their company about the human opportunity that open source is. Open source is one of the greatest contributor to scientific development. Nevertheless, we should not fool ourselves as some technologies could be misused by others to the detriment of the company and ourselves. I would definitely not release any technology without a common agreement.

2. _Alternatively, should companies (and universities) have the final say, including the right to stop publication of papers when it's in their interest to do so? (This is the de facto policy in many companies today.)_

If your collaborators want to publish something that could harm you, you will not let him publish. Moreover, the authors of the publication could not have done it without the company's material and collaboration, so they don't have the full property on the work. A common agreement is needed. Those are basic social rules.  If the authors really want to publish their work, they should probably be able to modify it such that it fits their company (or university's) interest.

3. _Should a company be responsible for ensuring the quality of research published under its name, or should this be left only to peer review?_

It's a false dilemma, each one is responsible for what he does. Companies are responsible for the research they make and submit, while publishers are responsible for what they review and publish. Poor publications proceed from poor quality check by the company and poor quality check by the publisher, so the responsibility is on both.

4. _Conversely, if a researcher publishes a scientifically flawed paper, does the fault lie with the researcher, or with both the researcher and the company?_

I would give essentially the same answer with a little more nuances. Companies trust their employees to some extent, while the publishers doesn't have to trust the company as much. Here, the researcher's fault is to have made an error (intentional or not), while the fault of the company and the publisher is to not having challenged the published work enough.

5. _What would be a reasonable prepublication review process within companies, and how can we ensure that it is applied fairly and consistently?_

I would just recommend reading the paper and discussing about controversial or misunderstood points. It's even better to challenge the data and programs together, while tracking the work. The more important the work, the more it requires quality check efforts.

6. _What rights and responsibilities do researchers and companies have with respect to patent filings of inventions in which they both played a part?_

I never really thought about this question. In my very humble opinion, I would briefly say that they need to find the right compromise between protecting their interests and sharing knowledge and technology to others for the development of mankind.
